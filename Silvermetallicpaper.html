        <p class="text-justify">Metallic finish almost creates a 3D effect
            and gives your photos a warmth and depth that no other paper
            can. Color is truly vibrant in this photo finish, and it&#39;s those bold
            colors that photographers rave about with metallic prints. Metallic
            paper is also really durable. These eye-catching labels are an
            effective way to add instant visual impact to anything you want
            your target audience to
            immediately see. As a result, metalized paper and films work in a
            variety of markets like food, beverage, bath &amp; beauty, and
            promotional. With the use of other inks, we can tint the metallic
            label material to create other colors that go perfectly with your
            brand, product, or sales strategy. In short, our customization
            options allow you to create appealing labels and stickers in any
            shape, size, color, or design. </p>
