                                <p>Delta Packaging uses machines to test the scuffing of printed materials. Scuffing usually occurs when there is friction between the two surfaces. This results in fading of the print due to abrasion of the film or paper. Prakash Labels takes precautions to avoid the scuffing when the label is put into real life working conditions.</p>
